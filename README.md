# Neural Network Project - Hotdog Classifier

A pure Python implementation of a neural network from scratch, featuring a hotdog image classifier. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of neural networks without using any machine learning libraries.

## Features

- Pure Python neural network implementation
- Image classification (Hotdog vs Not Hotdog)
- Interactive command-line interface
- Model saving and loading
- Training data management
- Xavier initialization
- Cross-entropy loss
- Early stopping

## Project Structure

- `neural_network.py`: Core neural network implementation
- `hotdog_classifier.py`: Hotdog classification application
- `image_processor.py`: Image processing utilities

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Pillow (PIL) for image processing

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/louiscross/NeuralNetworkProject.git
cd NeuralNetworkProject
